It is also one of the most typical Argentine dishes prepared by the different native Indian tribes at a time of the Spanish conquest. Its origin dates to before the Spanish colonial times.

American Kitchen Classic Pineapple Upside Down Cake,488235,60,The idea of cooking a cake upside down is an old technique that started in the middle ages when cakes were cooked in cast iron skillets. It was easy for the cook to add fruit and sugar in the bottom of the pan and a simple cake batter on top and put it over the fire to cook. Flipping it over onto a plate was a natural way to show the pretty fruit and to let the hot glaze run into the cake as well. The idea of using pineapple dates to soon after 1911 when James Dole of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company had both a machine to cut his pineapples into nice rings and the ability to can them as well. One of the earliest printed recipes for pineapple upside down cake is from a 1924 Seattle fundraising cookbook.

Hot and Sour Soup (Betty Foo; Hunan Restaurant),141637,15,"This is the recipe as taught in the Main Line School Night [winter, 2005] class on Regional Chinese Cooking by Betty Foo, chef & co-owner of the Hunan Restaurant in Ardmore, PA. Betty and her husband are from Hunan and have returned to visit, so the recipe is authentic to the region, both by family history, by recent comparison, and by my own review of Chinese regional cookbooks.

Originally a Sichuan regional specialty, hot and sour soup has become a staple at every chinese restaurant, no matter what regional style they claim as a specialty. Clearly, as with many soups, individual variations are easy and can vary the flavor considerably.

One of the ways I judge any chinese restaurant the first time I eat there is by the quality of their hot and sour soup ... this one is superb!

To make a kosher meat version, replace the pork with (kosher) chicken or turkey and replace the broth with a kosher broth (watch the salt if you use a commercial broth). To make a vegetarian version, use a vegetable broth and add a variety of sliced fresh mushrooms (e.g., shiitake, oyster). To make it vegan, use the above substitutions for vegetarian and skip the eggs.

Recipe makes about 48 oz of soup, so you can serve 4 @ 12 oz or 6 @ 8 oz.

October 2008 -- addendum. Thanks to all the fellow recipezaar foodies who have tried this recipe ... there have been two major issues raised: the amount of vinegar and the spiciness. Re the vinegar, I went back and asked Betty Foo about the ""white distilled"" vs ""rice"" vinegar. So far as she knows, both are the same acidity (5%, marked on the bottle) and while the taste is different (the rice vinegar provides a more subtle flavor), they ""should be"" equivalent. She noted that rice vinegar comes in a seasoned and unseasoned version (for Marukan, look at the label and the cap color to see the difference), but this shouldn't affect the acidity the vinegar provides. I'll make versions with both vinegars and update this note with some recommendations if I taste a significant difference.

Re the spiciness, as noted, this soup comes from Sichuan, known for its love of spiciness. It may be more than you are used to, so by all means, feel free to adjust the pepper components (and other components) to your taste. 

Also, re substituting fresh mushrooms for the dried, you should know that the dried mushrooms tend to give a more intense and woodsy flavor than fresh ... the opposite of the situation with fresh herbs vs dried. Don't be surprised if you prefer the recipe done with dried mushrooms!

Re the ginger, it should be added at step 11, with other spices. It adds to the ""hot"" flavor by infusing the broth and the pieces add to the texture. You could, if you wanted to increase the ""hot"" of the pepper and the crunch of the veggies, divide the ginger and add some at the end as a garnish. I prefer not to, simply because I prefer the hot and sour components to be more of a blended flavor ...","['dried lily buds', 'dried mushroom', 'firm tofu', 'pork', 'eggs', 'bamboo shoot', 'cornstarch', 'water', 'distilled white vinegar', 'sugar', 'soy sauce', 'salt', 'garlic powder', 'cayenne pepper', 'white pepper', 'chicken broth', 'scallions', 'gingerroot', 'sesame oil']","[""1/2  cup    dried lily buds (day lilies)"",""1/2  cup    dried mushroom (\""wood ears\"" or \""tree ears\"")"",""1/2  lb    firm tofu, julienned  (this will usually be 1 block or cake of tofu)"",""3/4  cup    pork, finely julienned  (see comments for vegetarian alternative)"",""2       eggs, lightly beaten "",""1/2  cup    bamboo shoot, julienned  (canned or fresh)"",""2   tablespoons    cornstarch"",""1/2  cup    water"",""5   tablespoons    distilled white vinegar"",""1/2  teaspoon    sugar"",""5   ounces    soy sauce (see comments)"",""1   teaspoon    salt"",""1/4  teaspoon    garlic powder (see comments)"",""1   teaspoon    cayenne pepper, ground "",""1   teaspoon    white pepper, ground "",""6   cups    chicken broth (see comments for vegetarian version)"",""2   tablespoons    scallions, finely chopped "",""2   tablespoons    gingerroot, finely chopped "",""1   teaspoon    sesame oil (optional, made from toasted sesame seeds preferred)""]",1 (376 g),4,"['Clean the dried day lilies, soak them in warm water for about 20 minutes.', 'Cut off the hard, tough tip of the stem and then cut the day lilies in half lengthwise.', ""Clean and soak the wood ear mushrooms in warm water for about 20 minutes, then cut into small pieces.

With this recipe, which I adapted from a soup to pot stickers, you have the choice of steaming or pan frying the dumplings.

We always serve the dim sum with both a sweet dipping sauce, (usually a purchased plum sauce) and a salty dipping sauce. You can also use freshly made dim sum wrappers, but as I am not to that confidence level in Asian cooking I will leave that to the culinary experts.

Wok's Happening! Jimmy's Kitchen Hong Kong Style Curried Fish,304509,30,"I LOVE Jimmy's Kitchen in Hong Kong - not the modern restaurant that is operating now, but the old one from the 1960's that was situated in Hong Kong Central.

You can make this as hot as you want - I always had it HOT when I ate it there! Use any firm white fish fillets, I use panga in France, but snapper, tilapia, sea bream or even plaice would be good. You can cut the fish into smaller pieces for ease of pan frying if you wish - I just like the ""whole"" fish effect on my plate when I serve this!

Asian Stuffed Eggplant With Hawaiian-Style Pork (Or Turkey) Hash,360851,60,"This is a dish that combines two things that I really like... eggplant and pork hash.

But instead of getting ice-cream, one could get pork hash, half moon, manapua, fried noodles, candies, almond cookies and other stuff.  

Pork Hash is kind of like a meatball wrapped in a won ton wrapper.  It is usually served with chinese mustard mixed with soy sauce.

Balthazar's Braised Beef Ribs,158079,15,"""This is our Saturday-night plat du jour and, because its preparation involves the basics of French cooking, it’s also the first dish we teach young cooks: There’s the browning of the meat, the softening of the mirepoix, the reduction of wine, and the long braise in stock. It’s a forgiving dish that calls for patience rather than precision. It’s also the ideal meal to make ahead of time, as it benefits greatly from a night’s rest. Serve with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Pan-Roasted Root Vegetables."" 
From The Balthazar Cookbook by Keith McNally, Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson. As with all tough cuts of meat, short ribs are best when braised. A long and gentle simmer breaks down the abundant fat and connective tissue, rendering the ribs tender and velvety in texture. Veal stock adds its own inherent silky richness. Ask the butcher to cut the ribs across the rack, as opposed to along the bone, so there are 3 short bones in every piece.","['short rib of beef', 'rosemary', 'thyme', 'bay leaf', 'celery', 'kosher salt', 'fresh coarse ground black pepper', 'vegetable oil', 'carrots', 'onion', 'shallots', 'garlic cloves', 'tomato paste', 'all-purpose flour', 'ruby port', 'wine', 'veal stock']","[""6       short rib of beef (5 to 7 pounds)"",""2   sprigs    rosemary"",""6   sprigs    thyme"",""1       bay leaf"",""1   stalk    celery, halved "",""3   teaspoons    kosher salt"",""2   teaspoons    fresh coarse ground black pepper"",""3   tablespoons    vegetable oil"",""3   medium    carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces "",""1   medium    onion, roughly chopped "",""4       shallots, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick "",""5       garlic cloves, peeled and halved "",""3   tablespoons    tomato paste"",""3   tablespoons    all-purpose flour"",""1/2  cup    ruby port"",""4   cups   full-bodied wine, such as cabernet sauvignon "",""6   cups    veal stock (veal stock is really best but you can substitute good homemade beef stock)""]",1 (270 g),4,"['Preheat the oven to 325°F', 'Bind each rib with cotton kitchen twine.

Pot Au Feu  (Pot on the Fire),177616,60,"This is one of my contributions for the French region in the Zaar World Tour.  I haven't tried it yet but I plan to soon and I think it would be a nice dish to serve in the Fall.
History:
Pot au Feu is French for “pot on the fire”. In other words, a stew or stock pot which is left cooking over the fire. In previous times, it may simply have been a cooking pot which was left over the fire, into which was thrown whatever food and scraps happened to be available. Often the meat was either scraps, or relatively poor cuts which needed a long time to cook in order to be tender. In historical terms, it was a dish for relatively poor people.
Today in France, one can buy “pot au feu” meat. Expect this to be meat which reflects the historical background of this dish: relatively inexpensive and inferior cuts, which will soften with long slow cooking. While such meat is quite adequate for a Pot au Feu, feel free to use better cuts if you wish.
As a Pot au Feu is historically a stew-like dish of whatever meat and vegetables were available, there are no absolute guidelines about what it should contain. However, in general it will contain beef, some bones (such as ox-tail) which have either marrow or cartilage (or both, depending on which bones are used), vegetables (such as carrots, onions, leeks, turnips) and spices. Due to concerns about CJD, this recipe excludes bones.","['beef', 'bacon', 'white pearl onions', 'garlic cloves', 'carrots', 'leeks', 'tomatoes', 'all-purpose flour']","[""3   lbs    beef, with bone  (plat de cote)"",""11   ounces    bacon, cut in stripes "",""10       white pearl onions, peeled "",""3      chopped garlic cloves"",""4   medium    carrots, peeled and cut into 4 cm cubes "",""2       leeks, washed and cut into 1 cm rings "",""5       tomatoes, chopped and peeled  (1 cup)"",""  all-purpose flour""]",1 (851 g),4,"['Brown meat in frying pan, adding salt and pepper.

Bring to the boil and add to casserole or slow cooker.', 'Cook at low temperature (150 Celsius) for about 5 hours or until the meat falls of the bone.', 'Serve with potatoes (boiled or fried).', 'Notes:', 'Depending on the meat being used, a Pot au Feu can be very rich. If you would like a leaner version, prepare it the day before and allow to cook overnight. Once cooled the fat will rise to the surface and it can be skimmed off. The dish can then be re-warmed.', 'Pot au Feu is often served with mustard and course salt.', 'After removing and serving the meat and vegetables, there will be a delicious sauce left over.

"Crock Pot Normandy Pork With Apples, Shallots &amp; Cider",191479,15,"A lovely slow cooked or crock pot recipe for tender chunks of pork cooked in cider with apples, shallots, creme fraiche & calvados. My own recipe devised for our Chambres d'Hotes here in France - and ALWAYS a firm favourite with guests, family & friends alike! It is my daughter's first night request when she comes home from university! You can use any cut of pork, but I usually use shoulder, neck, collar or blade of Pork - there are numerous names for that cut. It's sweeter and inclined to be more tender than Pork leg, which I feel is better roasted. You can also use Pork chops if you wish. If you have difficulty getting hold of cider or don't want to use alcohol, apple juice is just as good, for that appley zing! There is no duplicate for calvados, so just leave it out if you cannot obtain it, or use brandy or cognac instead. This makes a lovely pie filling if you have leftovers and as with most slow cooked recipes, it's very well behaved when re-heated! It goes extremely well with Recipe #191313 & mashed potatoes. N.B.

"The Perfect Non-Dairy, No-Sugar Spiced Chai",162847,15,"For eons, it seems, I have been experiementing with alternative ingredients to create the perfect cup of dairy free, sugar free spiced chai. 

Soy milk may work with coffee, but not with tea. Soy milk tends to unfortunately spoil tea by overpowering it with a chalky taste. This renders the use of soy milk as a dairy alternative in chai as problematic.

At long last I have come up with what I consider to be the perfect non-dairy, no-sugar chai. The chalky taste of soy milk is avoided with the use of almond milk, which is totally smooth in texture. It is also adequately complex and silky enough to stand in for condensed milk.

Samosas,117455,15,"This comes from the Time Life series of international cookbooks and has been a family favourite in our house for at least 10 years. It's best to set aside a morning to make these and haul someone in the kitchen to help put them together.

The seasoning given here is what I would consider a minimum but you may want to add more to your taste, especially when it comes to the hot pepper. You could also do half potatoes and half carrots for the filling if you like. The amount this recipe makes is also a guess based on our samosas, which are bigger than bite sized but not as big as you get in some Indian shops. If you don't have a deep fryer, you could use a wok instead. If you are really set on doing a healthier version, you could brush these with oil and bake in an oven until browned on both sides, however the texture of the dough is not as good as if you fry them.

Balti Beef,489894,30,"A delightful and easy mild curry adapted from ""Indian...Made Simple"", published by Parragon's Love Food division, no editor named. Balti recipes are usually associated with Birmingham, England, but the spice mixtures fit Indian cuisine.  The Balti creators hail from the north Pakistan province Baltistan in Kashmir.  Note that China, Pakistan and India all lay claim to that territory.  Lamb is more typical of Indian cuisine than beef. We used venison tenderloin and our meat came out well done; next time we will cut the meat in bigger chunks as we prefer it medium rare.  Note that a Vitamix can puree the sauce while it is still hot. Garlic and ginger paste is available in Indian groceries, or you can use Recipe #422497.  It's a great timesaver for a great taste combination.

Vindaloo,158702,15,"A Goan/South Indian dish with a Portuguese history combined, I started with a Pat Chapman recipe and modified it to my taste.  I was trying to come as close as possible to the vindaloo dishes I enjoyed at a particular Indian restaurant in Britain, and this is the result.
     There are some spices that I've rarely encountered at food stores locally and had to order through the internet, namely asafoetida and cassia bark, but these can be subbed with garlic powder and cinnamon, respectively with minimal effect.
     I've also found that the type and quantity of hot peppers used contribute significantly to the taste of the dish.  Times I've tried to make it in a mild form so others could eat it without having to call the fire department, it didn't turn out very well.  For this reason, I consider the type and quantity of pepper to be irreplaceable and that you have to like it HOT to really enjoy the dish.

Grilled Tandoori Chicken Pieces,226144,60,"Tandoori Chicken is a chicken dish dating back to the time of the Mughal Empire in Southern Asia; it is still popular throughout that area, as well as Central Asia. The chicken is marinated in a yogurt seasoned with garam masala - garlic, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper, and other spices depending on the recipe. It is traditionally moderately hot, but the heat is toned down to a ""mild"" taste level in most Western nations. Cayenne, red chili powder, or other spices give it its red colour. Turmeric produces a yellow-orange colour. In some modern versions red and yellow food colouring is used instead. It is traditionally cooked at high temperatures in an earthen oven (i.e. tandoor), but can also be prepared on a traditional grill. You can use any cuts of chicken you like.

Low-Fat Version of Indian Butter Chicken,235078,60,"This dish is super tasty and reasonably simple to prepare.  Because I cook for a multi-generational household (ages range from 3 y/o to 93 y/o) I have to make a number of tweaks to accommodate everyone's needs.

A Drum of Eggplant and Bucatini (Timballo Di Melanzane E Bucatin,282043,60,"Making a timballo, or timpano, is an event. It becomes the moment in which ordinary ingredients like macaroni, cheese, and vegetables are transformed into an extraordinary, impressive drum of baked pasta that, when unmolded, receives a standing ovation. 

The region of Campania claims the timballo as its own and the recipe that follows comes from Sorrento. It calls for bucatini, a thicker cut of hollow spaghetti, which neatly nestles and holds the ingredients together. It is customary in Campania to use buffalo milk mozzarella, a cheese with a delicate texture and superb taste, but it is very perishable and not readily available. Fresh cow's milk mozzarella can be used instead. 

Assembling the timballo is easy when done in stages. Make the sauce several days ahead; cube the cheese and cook the marble-size meatballs 2 days ahead. Patience is the key to the unmolding; you will get much neater wedges by allowing the timballo to cool for about 20 minutes - and the joy of tasting that first forkful will be worthy of the best drumroll.","['eggplants', 'salt', 'toasted breadcrumb', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'onion', 'celery rib', 'carrot', 'garlic cloves', 'plum tomatoes', 'dry red wine', 'bay leaf', 'fine sea salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'bucatini pasta', 'ground veal', 'egg', 'dry white wine', 'pecorino cheese', 'toasted breadcrumb', 'fine sea salt', 'fresh mozzarella cheese', 'fresh italian parsley', 'peanut oil', 'pecorino cheese']","[""3   large    eggplants (each at least 11 inches long)"",""  salt"",""1/2  cup    toasted breadcrumb"","""",""2   tablespoons    extra virgin olive oil"",""1/4  cup   finely chopped onion"",""1       celery rib, finely chopped "",""1   large    carrot, finely chopped "",""3       garlic cloves, minced "",""5   cups   chopped chopped fresh plum tomatoes (drained, about 10 medium size) or 5   cups    canned plum tomatoes (drained, about 10 medium size)"",""1/4  cup    dry red wine"",""1       bay leaf"",""1 1/2  teaspoons    fine sea salt"",""  fresh ground black pepper"","""",""2   cups    bucatini pasta, broken into thirds "",""1   lb    ground veal"",""1   large    egg, beaten "",""2   tablespoons    dry white wine"",""2   tablespoons   freshly grated pecorino cheese"",""1/2  cup    toasted breadcrumb"",""1   teaspoon    fine sea salt"",""1 1/2  cups   cubed fresh mozzarella cheese (fior di latte)"",""1/4  cup   chopped fresh Italian parsley"",""1/2  cup    peanut oil (for frying)"",""1/4  cup   freshly grated pecorino cheese""]",1 (304 g),10,"['Cut off the stems of the eggplants and discard.

Heart-Healthy Salmon Quesadillas,336713,30,"Canned wild salmon, whole wheat tortillas and nutrient-rich kale make this salmon quesadilla recipe an easy and nutritious heart healthy dinner.

Traditional Tamales (Pork),15286,15,"This tamale recipe is about as traditional as you can get, although I use a roast instead of the whole pig head that many Mexican women use. I have also used beef, but they just do not taste quite the same. These take about all day to make and are a lot of work, but they are so worth the time and the effort. Not for the faint-hearted cook for sure. They are a huge hit here in the West. For added flavor, top with either some of the red sauce used to prepare this recipe, or with my favorite, green chili sauce with pork, recipe #20574.

Thoroughly rub even layer of mixture onto all exterior surfaces, including bottom and sides. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Place chicken in medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate while preparing grill.', 'To grill the chicken: Using chimney starter, ignite about 6 quarts (1 large chimney, or 2 1/2 pounds) charcoal briquettes and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 15 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build two-level fire by arranging all coals in even layer in one half of grill.

Using long-handled grill tongs, dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil and wipe grill grate. Place chicken, skin-side down, on hotter side of grill; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken breasts and cook until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Move chicken skin-side up to cool side of grill and cover with disposable aluminum roasting pan; continue to cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast (not touching bone) registers 160 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to platter; let rest 10 minutes. Serve, passing sauce separately.', ""Taking Thai Chicken Indoors. If you don't have a grill, heat your oven to 450 degrees and adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position, as food tends to brown more deeply and evenly toward the bottom of the oven. Set the brined, rubbed chicken on a flat wire roasting rack and place the rack over a baking sheet lined with foil. Roast the chicken for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and then cook for an additional 15 minutes. The skin should be light golden brown, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each breast (not touching any bone) should register 160 degrees. To get the same deep brown exterior that the grill provides, finish the chicken with a quick shot under the broiler (2 to 3 minutes, with the chicken 6 to 8 inches from the broiler element). This pass under the broiler will help to crisp the skin, but the skin will probably not be quite as crisp as it is in the grilled version. The flavors, however, will be just as good.""]","['time-to-make', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'poultry', 'asian', 'thai', 'chicken', 'meat', 'chicken-breasts', '4-hours-or-less']","{'thai', 'chicken'}",Thai

Easy Yummy King Prawn Thai Green Curry,301905,30,"This is an easy recipe with amazing results.  I first tried this with fresh chilli, lemongrass and ginger, but the things I list here can be kept as part of your fridge/cupboard stock and therefore this can be made at the drop of a hat, pretty much no prep needed, and tastes just as good.  We have this on a weekly basis.

The consistency of the sauce will be quite thin, which is fine, do not try to thicken it, it is meant to be that way.  I serve this in a bowl, on a plate with the rice to the side, so you can scoop up a forkful of rice then dip and pick up prawns, mushrooms and sauce.

I would recommend tasting once you put the stock etc in, if it is too sweet, add more stock, you can tinker with the amount of stock and coconut milk to your taste.

The coriander must be fresh, it really makes the dish.

I've tried dozens of recipes for this dish, and this is the best that I've ever been able to do it. Obviously, it's open to interpretation: if you want it a bit more salty, add a bit more nam pla; if you want it a little sweeter, add a touch more palm sugar; if it's not spicy enough, add more chilli to the paste. 
In addition, I'd always go for the full fat coconut milk - it gives a far better texture to the dish. I'm very much from the Gina D'Acampo school of thought on this one - don't try to make healthy options; just go to the gym. 
Also note that the veggies in this are interchangeable for several other things - interchange the aubergine and beans for any other types of green veg - sugarsnap peas, runner beans, peppers etc.
Finally, I should also specify that the palm sugar should be dissolved in hot water before adding to the pot - this should be done entirely based upon taste, but as a starting point, I'd say that you should add a couple of tablespoons of sugar to 300ml of hot water.","['galangal', 'hot green chili peppers', 'lemongrass', 'palm oil', 'coconut milk', 'nam pla', 'palm sugar', 'chicken seasoning', 'chicken breast', 'aubergines', 'bamboo shoots', 'kaffir lime leaves', 'green beans', 'basil leaves']","["""",""2   slices   fresh galangal, thin slices "",""2   large    hot green chili peppers"",""1   stalk    lemongrass"","""",""4   teaspoons    palm oil"",""8   tablespoons   full fat coconut milk"",""2   tablespoons    nam pla (fish sauce)"",""6   tablespoons    palm sugar"",""1   teaspoon    chicken seasoning"",""1   large    chicken breast, thinly sliced "",""4   slices    aubergines, thin slices, quartered "",""2   tablespoons    bamboo shoots"",""6       kaffir lime leaves, ripped from the stem, stem thrown away "",""4   tablespoons    green beans"",""8      thai basil leaves, ripped ""]",1 (274 g),2,"[""Slice the galangal, green chilli and lemon grass very fine indeed.

Chris's Grilled Scallops on a Stick With Sriracha Dipping Sauce,460486,60,"Entered for safe-keeping for outdoor grilling.  Chris Grove (Nibblemethis.com) derived this variation from ""On a Stick"", & I have tweaked in case Sriracha sauce is too hard to find. Sriracha sauce is a paste of chili peppers, distilled vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt.  Traditional Thai Sriracha is tangier, sweeter and thicker in texture than non-Thai, but the U.S.-made Huy Fong Foods sauce made Sriracha a more common condiment.  For genuine Thai Sriracha, many prefer Shark Brand from Thailand; a recipe: http://www.shesimmers.com/2010/03/homemade-sriracha-how-to-make-authentic.html. Huy Fong sauce clones: Recipe #373759 #373759 & Recipe #312209 #312209.  Apparently some Thai people residing in the U.S. prefer to substitute Tabasco, Cholula or Valentina hot red sauces for Sriracha.  (Note: the double-skewer technique also works great for shrimp.)

Beef Shorties: Thai Inspired Beef Shortribs,524600,60,"It was a weekend.  It was raining like hell.  It was a good day to do nothing, but I had planned for something special... Father's Day.
